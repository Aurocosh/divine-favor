To use this rope just use it on any solid block and it will unroll itself as you walk. To pick it up you can just follow the rope back. As you approach latest node connected to you it will automatically be picked up. You can right click last node to connect or disconnect it."

All types of the rope will gradually degrade and disappear if left in the world for long enough, so if you want to reuse be sure to pick it up before you go."
